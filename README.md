# WBA Q3 2024 Rust Registration Task

This project is part of the WBA Q3 2024 Registration Task, where you'll perform key blockchain operations on the Solana network using Rust. The tasks include generating keypairs, converting keypair formats, transferring SOL, emptying a dev wallet to a WBA wallet, and enrolling on-chain with the WBA program.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
borsh = "1.5.1"
bs58 = "0.5.1"
solana-client = "2.0.3"
solana-program = "2.0.3"
solana-sdk = "2.0.3"
solana-idlgen = { git = "https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-idlgen.git" }
```

## Getting Started

1. **Generate a Keypair**

   The `keygen` function generates a new Solana keypair and prints the public key and private key bytes.

2. **Convert Base58 to Wallet and Vice Versa**

   - `base58_to_wallet`: Converts a Base58-encoded private key to a byte array.
   - `wallet_to_base58`: Converts a wallet file byte array to a Base58-encoded string.

3. **Airdrop SOL**

   The `airdop` function requests an airdrop of SOL to a specified dev wallet from the Solana devnet.

4. **Transfer SOL**

   The `transfer_sol` function transfers SOL from your dev wallet to the WBA wallet.

5. **Empty Wallet**

   The `empty_wallet` function transfers all SOL from your dev wallet to the WBA wallet, minus the transaction fee.

6. **Enroll in WBA**

   The `enroll_wba` function enrolls you on-chain with the WBA program by interacting with the `WbaPrereqProgram` and passing the necessary arguments.

## How to Run

To run the tests, use:

```bash
cargo test
```

Each function corresponds to a different task and can be run individually by specifying the function name. For example, to run the `keygen` function:

```bash
cargo test keygen -- --nocapture
```
